tltree : compute the contour tree of a 3D image with trilinear interpolation

usage: tltree ncols nrows nstacks infile [outfile]

    The first three arguments give the size of the image.  The input file
    should contain the image, stored as a sequence of bytes, one byte per
    voxel, in normal image order (columns, then rows, then 'stacks' or images.)
